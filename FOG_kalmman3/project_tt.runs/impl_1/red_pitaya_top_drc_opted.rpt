2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PLIO-8#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Terminal dac_pwm_o[0] has IOB constraint set to TRUE, but it is either not connected to a FLOP element or the connected FLOP element could not be brought into the I/O.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-8#2 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Terminal dac_pwm_o[1] has IOB constraint set to TRUE, but it is either not connected to a FLOP element or the connected FLOP element could not be brought into the I/O.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-8#3 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Terminal dac_pwm_o[2] has IOB constraint set to TRUE, but it is either not connected to a FLOP element or the connected FLOP element could not be brought into the I/O.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-8#4 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Terminal dac_pwm_o[3] has IOB constraint set to TRUE, but it is either not connected to a FLOP element or the connected FLOP element could not be brought into the I/O.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port exp_n_io[0] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
