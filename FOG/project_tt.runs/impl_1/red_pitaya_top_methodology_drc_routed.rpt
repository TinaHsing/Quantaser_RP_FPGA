There is a large setup violation of -7.162 ns between shifted_K_post_error/U0/i_synth/i_nonzero_fract.i_synth/i_algo_r2_or_lutmult.i_nonzero_fract.i_sdivider/i_sdivider.divider_blk/div_loop[11].adder_gen.reg_req.adsu_mod/add1/no_pipelining.the_addsub/i_q_simple.qreg/opt_has_pipe.first_q_reg[32]/C (clocked by pll_dac_clk_1x) and shifted_K_post_error/U0/i_synth/i_nonzero_fract.i_synth/i_algo_r2_or_lutmult.i_nonzero_fract.i_sdivider/i_sdivider.divider_blk/div_loop[16].adder_gen.reg_req.adsu_mod/add1/no_pipelining.the_addsub/i_q_simple.qreg/opt_has_pipe.first_q_reg[32]/D (clocked by pll_dac_clk_1x). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
